# React Product Basket

A simple React app showing a Product list and basket

```javascript
 npm i
 npm start
 npm run server
```

## Qs

- Optimal strategy for sharing CSS across multiple files in React structure?
- Components that "useContext" are coupled to their contexts - how best to avoid?
- How to avoid flickering on state changes? Is rendering null the standard strategy?
